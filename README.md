I’m **Lavarice**, a web developer who enjoys building practical tools, automations and small web apps.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: a **Leboncoin tracker** to monitor listings more easily and efficiently  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: modern **PHP/Python** best practices, web scraping and automation workflows  
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on: lightweight **web projects**, scripts and tools that solve real everyday problems  
- 💬 Ask me about: automating repetitive tasks, turning an idea into a simple web tool, or organizing a small project  
- 📫 How to reach me: via **GitHub issues** or the contact links on my profile  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love taking “boring” manual workflows and reducing them to a single click
