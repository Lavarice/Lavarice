## Hi there 👋

I’m **Lavarice**, a web developer who enjoys building practical tools, automations and small web apps that solve real problems.  
I like clean, readable code, simple architectures and projects that people actually use.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on  
  A **Leboncoin tracker** that helps follow listings more easily and efficiently:  
  - scraping and updating data regularly  
  - storing and organizing listings in a structured way  
  - adding filters, favorites and notifications to avoid missing good deals  

- 🌱 I’m currently learning  
  - modern **PHP** (structuring projects, security basics, clean code)  
  - **Python** for automation, scripting and data handling  
  - web scraping techniques and how to make them more reliable over time  

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on  
  - small but useful **web apps** (dashboards, trackers, monitoring tools…)  
  - scripts that automate repetitive tasks (data collection, notifications, exports…)  
  - open‑source utilities where I can learn from more experienced developers  

- 💬 Ask me about  
  - turning a manual process into a simple web tool or script  
  - organizing a small project (features, roadmap, basic architecture)  
  - ideas to track or monitor data from the web in a simple way  

- 📫 How to reach me  
  - via **GitHub issues** on my repos  
  - or using the contact links on my GitHub profile  

- ⚡ Fun fact  
  I really enjoy taking a “boring” workflow that takes hours and reducing it  
  to a script or a small interface that runs in a few seconds.
